# What's NMemory?
NMemory is a lightweight non-persistent in-memory relational database engine that is purely written in C# and can be hosted by .NET applications. It supports
traditional database features like indexes, foreign key relations, transaction handling and isolation, stored procedures, query optimization.

## Getting started
* Install [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NMemory)
* Define the database

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Group
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class MyDatabase : Database
{
    public MyDatabase()
    {
        var peopleTable = base.Tables.Create<Person, int>(p => p.Id);
        var groupTable = base.Tables.Create<Group, int>(g => g.Id);

        var peopleGroupIdIndex = peopleTable.CreateIndex(
            new RedBlackTreeIndexFactory<Person>(), 
            p => p.GroupId);

        this.Tables.CreateRelation(
            groupTable.PrimaryKeyIndex, 
            peopleGroupIdIndex, 
            x => x, 
            x => x);

        this.People = peopleTable;
        this.Groups = groupTable;
    }

    public ITable<Person> People { get; private set; }

    public ITable<Group> Groups { get; private set; }
}
```

* Create a database instance and some data

```csharp
MyDatabase db = new MyDatabase();

db.Groups.Insert(new Group { 
    Id = 1, 
    Name = "Alpha Group" });

db.Groups.Insert(new Group { 
    Id = 2, 
    Name = "Beta Group" });

db.People.Insert(new Person { 
    Id = 1, 
    Name = "John Doe", 
    GroupId = 1, 
    BirthDay = new DateTime(1966, 4, 12) });
```

* Perform queries

```csharp
var query =
    from p in db.People
    join g in db.Groups on p.GroupId equals g.Id
    select new { Name = p.Name, Group = g.Name };
    
query.ToList()
```

* Manipulate data

```csharp
var q = db.Groups.Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("B"));

// Update command
q.Update(x => new Group { Name = x.Name + " (taged)" });

// Delete command
q.Delete();
```

### Why should I contribute to this free & open-source library?
We all love free and open-source libraries! But there is a catch... nothing is free in this world.

We NEED your help. Last year alone, we spent over **3000 hours** maintaining all our open source libraries.

Contributions allow us to spend more of our time on: Bug Fix, Development, Documentation, and Support.

### How much should I contribute?
Any amount is much appreciated. All our free libraries together have more than **100 million** downloads.

If everyone could contribute a tiny amount, it would help us make the .NET community a better place to code!

Another great free way to contribute is  **spreading the word** about the library.

A **HUGE THANKS** for your help!
